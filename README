Friendly DVD to Playable ISO Converter
======================================

I had to convert a whole bunch of typical VIDEO_TS folders to watchable-on-a-DVD-player disk images for a family thing.

You know when you want to just write a quick script to speed-up a monotonous task you're doing, but the developer in you makes you want to turn it into a full-blown application?

This is one of those applications.

Usage
-----

No binaries / distributable are distributed with the source at this time. You can either run it from source using the python interpreter or 'compile' a friendly, convenient .app bundle (or, indeed, a win32 executable, but that won't help most people).

To run source from commandline (duh):

`python dvd_to_iso.py`

Or, to bundle it all into an Application (requires [py2app](http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html)):

`python setup.py py2app`
